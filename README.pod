Catalyst::Plugin::I18N::PathPrefixGeoIP - A drop in for atalyst::Plugin::I18N::PathPrefix that uses GeoIP


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in MyApp.pm
  use Catalyst qw/
    I18N I18N::PathPrefixGeoIP
  /;
  __PACKAGE__->config('Plugin::I18N::PathPrefixGeoIP' => {
    valid_languages => [qw/en de fr/],
    fallback_language => 'en',
    language_independent_paths => qr{
        ^( votes/ | captcha/numeric/ )
    }x,
    geoip_db => 'data/GeoLiteCity.dat',
  });
  __PACKAGE__->setup;

  # now the language is selected based on requests paths:
  #
  # http://www.example.com/en/foo/bar -> sets $c->language to 'en',
  #                                      dispatcher sees /foo/bar
  #
  # http://www.example.com/de/foo/bar -> sets $c->language to 'de',
  #                                      dispatcher sees /foo/bar
  #
  # http://www.example.com/fr/foo/bar -> sets $c->language to 'fr',
  #                                      dispatcher sees /foo/bar
  

  # http://www.example.com/foo/bar    -> used GeoIP to sets $c->language
  #                                      If GeoIp dos not fain a mach it fails
  #                                      over to use language from
  #                                      Accept-Language header,
  #                                      dispatcher sees /foo/bar
  #
  # or if redirect_to_language_url == 1:
  #
  # http://www.example.com/foo/bar    -> redirect to http://www.example.com/xx/foo/bar
  #                                      where xx is language from Accept-Language header

  # in a controller
  sub language_switch : Private
  {
    # the template will display the language switch
    $c->stash('language_switch' => $c->language_switch_options);
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to put the language selector as a prefix to the path part of
the request URI without requiring any modifications to the controllers (like
restructuring all the controllers to chain from a common base controller).

(Internally it strips the language code from C<< $c->req->path >> and appends
it to C<< $c->req->base >> so that the invariant C<< $c->req->uri eq
$c->req->base . $c->req->path >> still remains valid, but the dispatcher does
not see the language code - it uses C<< $c->req->path >> only.)

Throughout this document 'language code' means ISO 639-1 2-letter language
codes, case insensitively (eg. 'en', 'de', 'it', 'EN'), just like
L<I18N::LangTags> supports them.

Note: You have to load L<Catalyst::Plugin::I18N> if you load this plugin.

Note: HTTP already have a standard way (ie. Accept-Language header) to allow
the user specify the language (s)he prefers the page to be delivered in.
Unfortunately users often don't set it properly, but more importantly Googlebot
does not really support it (but requires that you always serve documents of the
same language on the same URI). So if you want a SEO-optimized multi-lingual
site, you have to have different (sub)domains for the different languages, or
resort to putting the language selector into the URL.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

You can use these configuration options under the C<'Plugin::I18N::PathPrefixGeoIP'>
key:

=head2 valid_languages

  valid_languages => \@language_codes

The language codes that are accepted as path prefix.

=head2 fallback_language

  fallback_language => $language_code

The fallback language code used if the URL contains no language prefix and
L<Catalyst::Plugin::I18N> cannot auto-detect the preferred language from the
C<Accept-Language> header or none of the detected languages are found in
L</valid_languages>.

=head2 language_independent_paths

  language_independent_paths => $regex

If the URI path is matched by C<$regex>, do not add language prefix and ignore
if there's one (and pretend as if the URI did not contain any language prefix,
ie.  rewrite C<< $c->req->uri >>, C<< $c->req->base >> and C<< $c->req->path >>
to remove the prefix from them).

Use a regex that matches all your paths that return language independent
information.

If you don't set this config option or you set it to an undefined value, no
paths will be handled as language independent ones.

=head2 redirect_to_language_url

  redirect_to_language_url => 1

Redirect users to url with language prefix.

Without redirect_to_language_url users may access your site using bout urls with a 
language selector and without. This may be bad for search engine optimization because 
search engines will have a hard time determine the original source for documents. 
Setting redirect_to_language_url will redirect users to a url with language prefix.

=head2 debug

  debug => $boolean

If set to a true value, L</prepare_path_prefix> logs its actions (using C<<
$c->log->debug(...) >>).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 setup_finalize

Overridden (wrapped with an an C<after> modifier) from
L<Catalyst/setup_finalize>.

Sets up the package configuration.

=head2 prepare_path

Overridden (wrapped with an an C<after> modifier) from
L<Catalyst/prepare_path>.

Calls C<< $c->prepare_path_prefix >> after the original method.

=head2 prepare_path_prefix

  $c->prepare_path_prefix()

Returns: N/A

If C<< $c->req->path >> is matched by the L</language_independent_paths>
configuration option then calls C<< $c->set_languages_from_language_prefix >>
with the value of the L</fallback_language> configuration option and
returns.

Otherwise, if C<< $c->req->path >> starts with a language code listed in the
L</valid_languages> configuration option, then splits language prefix from C<<
$c->req->path >> then appends it to C<< $c->req->base >> and calls C<<
$c->set_languages_from_language_prefix >> with this language prefix.

Otherwise, it tries to select an appropriate language code:

=over

=item *

It picks the first language code C<< $c->languages >> that is also present in
the L</valid_languages> configuration option.

=item *

If no such language code, uses the value of the L</fallback_language>
configuration option.

=back

Then appends this language code to C<< $c->req->base >> and the path part of
C<< $c->req->uri >>, finally calls C<< $c->set_languages_from_language_prefix >>
with that language code.

=head2 set_languages_from_language_prefix

  $c->set_languages_from_language_prefix($language_code)

Returns: N/A

Sets C<< $c->languages >> to C<$language_code>.

Called from both L</prepare_path_prefix> and L</switch_language> (ie.
always called when C<< $c->languages >> is set by this module).

You can wrap this method (using eg. the L<Moose/after> method modifier) so you
can store the language code into the stash if you like:

  after set_languages_from_language_prefix => sub {
    my $c = shift;

    $c->stash('language' => $c->language);
  };

=head2 uri_for_in_language

  $c->uri_for_in_language($language_code => @uri_for_args)

Returns: C<$uri_object>

The same as L<Catalyst/uri_for> but returns the URI with the C<$language_code>
path prefix (independently of what the current language is).

Internally this method temporarily sets the paths in C<< $c->req >>, calls
L<Catalyst/uri_for> then resets the paths. Ineffective, but you usually call it
very infrequently.

Note: You should not call this method to generate language-independent paths,
as it will generate invalid URLs currently (ie. the language independent path
prefixed with the language prefix).

Note: This module intentionally does not override L<Catalyst/uri_for> but
provides this method instead: L<Catalyst/uri_for> is usually called many times
per request, and most of the cases you want it to use the current language; not
overriding it can be a significant performance saving. YMMV.

=head2 switch_language

  $c->switch_language($language_code)

Returns: N/A

Changes C<< $c->req->base >> to end with C<$language_code> and calls C<<
$c->set_languages_from_language_prefix >> with C<$language_code>.

Useful if you want to switch the language later in the request processing (eg.
from a request parameter, from the session or from the user object).

=head2 language_switch_options

  $c->language_switch_options()

Returns: C<< { $language_code => { name => $language_name, uri => $uri }, ... } >>

Returns a data structure that contains all the necessary data (language code,
name, URL of the same page) for displaying a language switch widget on the
page.

The data structure is a hashref with one key for each valid language code (see
the L</valid_languages> config option) (in all-lowercase format) and the value
is a hashref that contains the following key-value pairs:

=over

=item name

The localized (translated) name of the language. (The actual msgid used in C<<
$c->loc() >> is the English name of the language, returned by
L<I18N::LangTags::List/name>.)

=item url

The URL of the equivalent of the current page in that language (ie. the
language prefix replaced).

=back

You can find an example TT2 HTML template for the language switch included in
the distribution.

=head2 valid_languages

  $c->valid_languages

Returns: Array of valid language codes

C<< valid_languages >> returns the language codes you configured in the valid_languages configuration.

Useful if you want to go through all valid languages. For example to make a sitemap.

=begin internal

  $c->_set_language_prefix($language_code)

Sets the language to C<$language_code>: Mangles C<< $c->req->uri >> and C<<
$c->req->base >>.

=end internal

=begin internal

  my $scope_guard = $c->_set_language_prefix_temporarily($language_code)

Sets the language prefix temporarily (does the same as L</_set_language_prefix>
but returns a L<Scope::Guard> instance that resets the these on destruction).

=end internal

=begin internal

  $c->_language_prefix_debug($message)

Logs C<$message> using C<< $c->log->debug("Plugin::I18N::PathPrefixGeoIP: $message") >> if the
L</debug> config option is true.

=end internal

=begin internal

  _ip2contry($geoip_obj, $ipadress)

Find contry for ip

=end internal

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks for Larry Leszczynski for the idea of appending the language prefix to
C<< $c->req->base >> after it's split off of C<< $c->req->path >>
(L<http://dev.catalystframework.org/wiki/wikicookbook/urlpathprefixing>).

Thanks for Tomas (t0m) Doran <bobtfish@bobtfish.net> for the code reviews,
improvement ideas and mentoring in general.
